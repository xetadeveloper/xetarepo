Hello, 

Please i am having issue with getting this code to run faster, i am using it for my final year
dissertation. I will really appreciate ypur help on it if you can helo me optimize the code to be faster.

The code is in MATLAB and it's a code for Zero Normalzied Cross Correlation which i want to use for template matching.
I have attached all the files including a screenshot of my profiling of the code which is very slow. I have also attached the workspace needed. 

Other things you need to know are in the "Recommended Instruction for Executing Code.txt" file.

I will really appreciate it if you can help me.

Thanks a lot
