-I have put the Zero Normalized Cross Correlation code into the znccPrf.mlx file, 
please run that file to see what I mean.

-The necessary variable for the function "enrollTemplateImg" is saved in the workspace.mat file.
and the variable is the template image to be run against the other image "finger1E.tif".

-The other pictures are just the screenshots of my profiling the ZNCC code

Thanks so much as you help me, I really appreciate it.
